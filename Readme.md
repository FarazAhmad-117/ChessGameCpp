3- Paste these files to the include folder of your compiler.<br>
4- Copy the libbgi.a binary file.<br>
5- Paste it inside the bin folder of your compiler.<br>
6- Now you can compile the game by going in to the terminal and using this command (g++ main.cpp -o main -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32 -lwinmm)<br>
