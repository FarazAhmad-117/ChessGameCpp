I am providing this code with a lot of comments so you can understand the thought process involved in development of such
games.

### Tasks Ahead:

1 - Incorporate sound to Chess.  Done !<br>
2 - pawnPromotion fuction.  Done !<br>
3 - On change Movement Do not Show all movements and then mute all movements just mute last focus and show new focus.  Done !<br>

### Error Was great and I was unable to solve it at this moment: The reason I don't know! At the Moment!

So I am going to make anoher version 1.5.0

## How to Setup the project:
1- First of all clone this repo.
2- Open the dependences folder and copy c header files namely graphics.h and winbgim.h 
3- Paste these files to the include folder of your compiler.
4- Copy the libbgi.a binary file.
5- Paste it inside the bin folder of your compiler.
6- Now you can compile the game by going in to the terminal and using this command (g++ main.cpp -o main -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32 -lwinmm)
7- If you were unable to locate respective folders you can youtube to find them!
8- You will get a main.exe if was not already present.

## Enjoy the Game
